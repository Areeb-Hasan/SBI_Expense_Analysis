This document is an expense analysis from SBI Bank that compares planned versus actual expenses and calculates the variances. The analysis is broken down into four main expense categories: Employee costs, Office costs, Marketing costs, and Training/travel. The document includes a table of planned expenses by month and category, a table of actual expenses, and a table showing the variance between the two.

The total planned expenses for the year were ₹1,609,930.00, while the actual expenses were ₹782,939.00, resulting in a total variance of ₹826,991.00. This means that actual expenses were 51% less than what was planned.

A breakdown of the variances by category is as follows:

Employee costs: Planned expenses were ₹1,355,090.00, actual expenses were ₹659,130.00, with a variance of ₹695,960.00. The variance percentage for this category is 51%.
